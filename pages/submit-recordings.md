2.  Click the **Create New File** button. 
3.  Copy the front matter tags and format from another post. 
4.  Customize the tags with your own values.
5.  Submit the pull request.
6.  To upload your audio files, you can FTP them into the writethedocspodcast directory. Contact us on the [WTD Slack channel](https://writethedocs.slack.com/messages/podcast) for the FTP info. Alternatively, contact us [another way](/contact/).
