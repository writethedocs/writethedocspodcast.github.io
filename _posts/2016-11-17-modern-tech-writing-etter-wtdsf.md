Recently, Andrew Etter published [Modern Technical Writing: An Introduction to Software Documentation](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Technical-Writing-Introduction-Documentation-ebook/dp/B01A2QL9SS). The book presents an argument for writing in lightweight markup, storing it in distributed version control, and using static site generators. This talk features a short summary of an already short book, lessons learned during the Kindle publishing process, and the additions and changes Andrew would make to a hypothetical second edition.

**Here's a little about Andrew in his own words:**

I lead the technical writing team at Palantir Technologies. My job is to produce great documentation, streamline the delivery process, and ensure the happiness and productivity of my brilliant team of writers. During my career, I've also worked in quality assurance and customer support. I count myself very lucky to have been involved in the software industry for just shy of a decade.
