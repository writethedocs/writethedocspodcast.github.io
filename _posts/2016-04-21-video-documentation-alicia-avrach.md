Curious about video documentation?

What is it really? What are some best practices?

We are pleased to have Alicia Avarch, who will discuss video documentation, including:

* What it takes to produce animation, screencam, and talking head videos.
* Building a great user experience when you have both video and text docs.
* Bootstrapping video production without a big team or a ton of money.
* Measuring the effectiveness of video.
