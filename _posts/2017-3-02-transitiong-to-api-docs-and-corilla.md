This recording contains two presentations:

## Transitioning into API Technical Writing

Presenter: Priya Varghese, Google

A person who’s thinking of specialising in API tech writing may reflect on a number of fair questions:

* Do I know enough to explain APIs to developers?
* What if I don’t know how to code?
* How different is it to technical writing for other audiences?
* Is it even remotely possible that creating developer documentation can be fun?

Hear about how Priya Varghese literally stumbled her way into API tech writing, as she shares her experience about what helped her navigate into the developer landscape.

**About Priya Varghese**

Priya lives in Sydney where she collects succulents, fruit trees, and jigsaw puzzles with her husband, two children, and a pineapple conure named Sophia (Yup. The bird does all this with them!) She’s been a tech writer in security, and education fields for 8 years before working at Google.

## The Corilla Story

Presenter: David Ryan, Co-Founder and MD, Corilla

David Ryan will talk about the journey of a bunch of technical writers that started to tinker with some code in a back room at Red Hat's Brisbane office. Fast forward two rollercoaster years later and Corilla is an alumni of the NUMA accelerator in Paris, has team spread across 4 countries, customers in over 80, and has raised venture capital and funding from the likes of Google For Entrepreneurs and Bob Young, Co-founder and first CEO of Red Hat.

David will share the team's lessons learned launching a collaborative publishing tool, the difficulties in transitioning a project to a product, and the surprising shifts in the technical writing industry as a whole.
